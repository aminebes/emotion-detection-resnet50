# Core deep learning framework
tensorflow                # Provides tools to build and train deep learning models
tensorflowjs              # Used for webpage deployment

# Essential libraries for data manipulation and processing
numpy                     # Support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrix operations
pandas                    # Data analysis library, useful for handling structured data (e.g., CSV files)

# Image processing library
opencv-python             # Used for image loading and processing tasks (e.g., resizing images)

# Libraries for data visualization
matplotlib                # Basic plotting library for visualizations
seaborn                   # Statistical data visualization, builds on top of matplotlib

# Machine learning utilities
scikit-learn              # Provides functions for evaluation metrics, data splitting, etc.

# Additional tools for enhanced interactivity and progress tracking
ipython                   # Interactive Python shell, useful in Jupyter notebooks and enhances interactive coding
tqdm                      # Displays progress bars for loops, useful for tracking progress during training or data processing

# Configuration file handling
pyyaml                    # Allows reading and writing YAML files (e.g., config.yaml for storing parameters)

# System resource monitoring
psutil                    # Monitor system (CPU, memory, disk, etc.) usage during runtime
